SOLPSplotter is a tool for plotting the neutral opaqueness results.
The coding pattern of SOLPSxport is adopted. Functions from SOLPSxport code, Richard Reksoatmodjo's scripts (Github account name: Reksoatr), and Eric Emdee's python code are used.

The input data and output data are all stored in one instance variable, self.data and it is transmitted through the green arrow.

Fig. 2 is the future arrangement of each module and class setting. The smaller box is the subclass of the larger box and inherits property from the larger ones.
