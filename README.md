SOLPSplotter is a tool for plotting the neutral opaqueness results.
Coding pattern of SOLPSxport is adopted. Functions from SOLPSxport code and Richard Reksoatmodjo's scripts (Github account name: Reksoatr) are used.

The input data and output data are all stored in one instance variable, self.data and it is transmitted through the green arrow. The black boxes lumped together in the middle of Fig. 1 means that the smaller box is the subclass of the larger box and inherit property for the larger ones. Functions on the right hand side in Fig. 1 shows that they are functions used in the classes in the middle.
