SOLPSplotter is a tool for plotting the neutral opaqueness results.
Coding pattern of SOLPSxport is adopted. Functions from SOLPSxport code and Richard Reksoatmodjo's scripts (Github account name: Reksoatr) are used.

The input data and output data are all stored in one instance variable, self.data and it is transmitted through the green arrow.
